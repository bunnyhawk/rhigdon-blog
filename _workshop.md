## Definition of Done

1) The story is groomed and approved before development
2) All acceptance criteria for a story has been met
3) Unit tests are written and pass. (Ideally addressing AC)
4) Code is clear and documentation is written (when needed)
5) Q/A has signed off on look and functionality in a staging environment.
6) Optional but ideal: End to End testing is written.
7) Work is checked and signed off in a production environment.

## Conducting the technical interview

• Stop trying to "trick" your candidates
• Depending on the role, deep-cut knowledge of CS fundamentals aren't important
  • Is your dev actually going to build a data graph?
• White-boarding has it's limits
• Do your best to display this work AS IT IS in real life.
• Culture fit - room for unconscious bias
• Diversify your teams
