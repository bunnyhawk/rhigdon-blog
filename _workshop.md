## Conducting the technical interview

• Test for the fundamentals first, then your stack specifics
• Stop trying to "trick" your candidates
• White-boarding has it's limits
• CS degree is NOT important
  • Is your dev actually going to build a data graph?
  • You can learn a lot of valuable things in school, but we all find our own path in to this field
• Do your best to display this work AS IT IS in real life.
• Culture fit - room for unconscious bias
• Diversify your teams
