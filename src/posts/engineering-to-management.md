It has (sadly) been almost a year since I've written here. Last year I moved from an individual contributor role to that of an engineering manager. I'm overdue on writing down some early takeaways for anyone that's looking to make a similar move.

I'll start by saying this: **management is not for everyone**. Make sure you're in this for the right reasons. You'll have several people's career paths, salary potential, and mental health in your hands and this shouldn't be taken lightly. You'll also likely be getting almost completely out of actual developing day-to-day. If this is important to you, it's something you need to strongly consider.

That said, if you're looking to take mentorship to the next level and help some wonderful people grow, management is probably the most interesting way (in my very biased opinion) to do just that.

## Helpful skills
There are a few traits thare are going to help your ramp up in this new career quickly. Some of them might not come naturally to you, but it's important to continue to improve yourself. Leadership is a learned skill.

The first, and arguably the most important skill to have is **a strong sense of empathy**. You are the first go-to in your organization for all sort of problems, both work and personal. There will be times when people want action, and there are times when people just want to be heard. This is why you need **the ability to deeply listen** to your team.

Beyond some of the "softer skills", you'll want to practice getting better with **managing your time**. This means starting to understand when you are most productive in different areas: socially (communicating via 1 on 1s), writing (documentation), completing data/math heavy tasks (forcasting / analyisis on metrics or velocity). If you're like me and you are more focused for data heavy tasks in the morning, make sure you're scheduling your meetings around that as much as possible. Block out the time on your calendar if you need to.

The final piece in overall time management is getting comfortable ruthlessly **prioritizing** tasks for both yourself and your team. There will always be far more than you can accomplish in a given quarter. Decide what's most important, work with product to get buy-in, and try to stick with that.

## Misconceptions
**"You need to be an extrovert"**\
Introverts can absolutely be just as successful in management. Your team isn't looking for someone that can small talk (though there is nothing wrong with that), they are looking for someone that truly listens to them. We all have different social interaction styles. Leaders can come from anywhere.

**"Being a leader is a personality type or 'born' to be that way"**\
Like any other learned skill, leadership takes time, training, and a level of dedication. If you can put the effort in and you care about your people, you'll find success.

**You need to be smarter than your team**\
This is so wrong that it's painful to type out. You need to be there to connect the dots for your people and guard their time, not to do the work for them.

## Challenges ahead
For me, the hardest challenge of all was **letting go of the reigns** and allowing my team to succeed and fail (especially fail) on their own. As a manager, your jumping in to write code and solve problems is only going to set them back long term. Let folks figure things out. Slow down to speed up.

Another challenge for some is around **the title and compensation changes**. You're possibly going to be managing former teammates, people who are smarter than you, and people who might make more money than you (or who have higher earning potential long-term). This might be a large change for someone coming in from a very highly valued individual contributor role. You can make very good money as an engineering manager, but at some companies, your earning potential could be capped lower than you'd expect as an engineer at the highest levels. I've made my peace with this, but it's something you need to consider.

## Preparing for the transition
A smart first step in your transition is **finding a mentor**. You'll be navigating a completely new skillset in this role and having someone you can lean on for support is going to go a long way. If your company is large enough, you can look interally for mentorship. Try to find formal mentorship programs or ask your leadership if they know of anyone you can pair up with. If your company is smaller (or even if not), you can reach outside to your online network. "Tech Twitter" can be a strong resource here. There are plenty of folks willing to share their struggles and tips for managing them.

Next up is working with existing leadership to **understand the priorities of your new role**. You're going to have a lot of new work on your plate that you might never have dealt with before. Things like performance reviews, compenstation discussions, and organizational goal setting. [Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) has a great way to distilling prioritization down (I'm paraphasing a bit here): "As an engineering manager, you'll need to put company first, team second, your team members third, and yourself as fourth." As a manager, you're helping your team connect to the overall company goals.

Beyond understanding your priorities, you'll need to start thinking ahead and **planning out your weeks**. It's easy to get caught in a meeting hell. You'll now be the go-to for every question that pertains to the products and features your team oversees. Map out your 1 on 1s around the standing meetings and lump similar things together. Context switching can be a real time suck. Block out focus time as much as possible.

* Looking ahead (for your team, it's people, and yourself)
