Even after all of these years, there is nothing in this field that scares me quite like going through rounds of technical interviews. I've been through serious highs and some brutal lows. I'm never quite sure what I'm going to get asked and what style of interview I'm about to participate in.

I've also been on the other side of this. It has it's own set of headaches and stress. It is especially complicated when you're looking for a senior level role in a language that you maybe aren't as familiar with yourself (or perhaps don't know at all). 

## Where are we getting it wrong?

The Googles and Amazons of the world have very specific interview styles. Rounds and rounds of computer science questions followed by hypothetical "brain teasers".

"How would you go about calculating how many balls are inside of this car?"

"How much should you charge to wash all the windows in New York?"

These are interesting as a logic experiment, and maybe they can even give you some insight on a person's thought process, but there are plenty of well qualified people that struggle with this sort of question. There are hundreds of articles and websites that train you specifically on how to get through this interview process. The whole process is dog-fooding itself and good people are getting passed on.

I'm going to start with a short list of where we are getting it wrong.

### "Culture fit" reinforces unconscious bias

We all want to be around people we objectively "like". The classic example tossed around is the old "beer test". Would you want to get a beer with this person? Culture fit is a way of weeding people out that aren't "like us" though. We aren't hiring a best friend. We are hiring a person that is a good fit for the open role available.

Organizations **thrive** with diverse people, thoughts, and backgrounds. Tech knows this. They've been pushing on diversity reports for the last six years, but [little has changed](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html). We've had a long history of hiring through [gate-keeping and personal relationships](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-06-24/tech-started-publicly-taking-lack-of-diversity-seriously-in-2014-why-has-so-little-changed-for-black-workers) which makes it notoriously difficult to get a foot in the door.

Even when we get diversity in the room, we still have a huge problem with a [lack of diversity in our AI software](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/tech-computers-are-bigger-problem-diversity/592456/). We **need** a more broad workforce in every industry, but especially in tech. 

### White-boarding has it's limits

Writing code by hand is a learned skill. You need to be very careful about how much importance you are weighting this in the interview process. This isn't how people work day to day and it shouldn't ultimately be what you use to judge their ability to do the job.

Even strong developers can get caught up here. Use white-boarding sparingly, if at all.

### Stop trying to "trick" your candidates

This is especially true for junior roles. Your trick questions aren't telling you anything about how qualified a person is to take on a role. There are plenty of intelligent candidates that will get caught up on these in an interview setting.

Please stop with this nonsense.

### CS degree requirements have got to go

Expectations around complete knowledge of everything taught through a computer science is antiquated. There are plenty of self-taught developers out there, myself included. We haven't all had the upbringing or resources to have finished (or even started) college. You can learn a lot of valuable things in school, but we all find our own path in to this field.

Is your dev actually required to build a graph data structure? If answer is yes, ask away. Keep in mind though, algorithms and data structure can quickly be taught. Be certain of what you are expecting day-one from your candidates. 

## How do we fix it?

Where do we even start? Ever position is going to be different. We all need to do better to set our candidates (and frankly, ourselves) up for a smoother interview experience.

### Test the fundamentals first, then your tech stack

Be up-front about your stack before the interview even starts. If the expectation of the job is a reliance on specific algorithms, let the candidate know that. Any decent developer can adapt to your coding style and stack. What we are actually trying to assess is where they are currently, and what strengths and weaknesses they might have.

Ask broader questions to gauge a person's thought process. Most of technology is built on the same fundamental principles.

### Pay people for their time

This one tends to be controversial, but I stand firm behind it. If you are asking for a good chunk of time out of a person's day/week to get through rounds of interviews, pay them for it. 

I've spent 40 hours on a **single round** of an interview. This level of commitment isn't fair to anyone. Show them you are serious about their effort and your commitment to bring the best talent on board.

### Coding challenges need to mirror real-world work

Here is a brief list of possible interview scenarios that you could leverage. I can't tell you what's right for your company, your personal available time, and the position.

The first one is obviously going to take more setup, but it will get easier moving forward.

#### Paired programming (work on real bugs)

Set aside some stories or bugs that take a little less background and context on a project (and obviously less time-sensitive). Have the candidate pair with you and your team on them. Work through real issues they will be dealing with in your actual code base. 

Concerned about trade secrets or sensitive information? That's what an NDA is for. Most of us aren't working with government-level security risks though.

#### Bring in, build a project (solo & with google), and then quiz about decisions made

I consider this one better suited to more senior positions, but it can be done effectively for junior folks if you give them more room for error. As stated above, this is a time commitment, so pay them for their time.

Let your interviewee sit alone with internet access and have them build something. The ideal is something similar to a product they might be working on, but anything can be fine. Try to make it something that hasn't been done to death (like a TODO application). 

This process can be language agnostic if you want. We are looking to see how our candidate thinks through a start-to-finish project. This will give you insight on coding style, project structure preferences, and just comfort in where they are as a developer.

Sit down with them after their alloted time and talk about it. They don't have to have it finished or even working. This is your time to dive a little deeper in to the hows and whys of what they just made.

#### Write unit tests to develop against

Write out some unit tests against explicit acceptance criteria. Give the interviewee the opportunity to write code to get the tests passing. Similarly to the project scenario, let them use the internet. We all use it in our jobs day to day.

#### Write broken functions with working unit tests

Write broken code with working unit tests. Let the candidate debug the code and try to figure out what's wrong. Do your best to stick with code that's similar to what they will be working with (or where you intend to take your stack at the very least).

### Check your bias - Diversify your teams

I'm not going to lie. This is never going to be easy. Here are a few steps your company likely needs to take.

1) Consider the whole person's background, not just their schooling. People have a complicated history and the how's and why's of their journey towards this industry isn't likely clear-cut. A 4.0 grade average and an ivy league school on a resume tells me almost nothing other than you likely grew up with some money in your family.

2) Throw "Culture Fit" out of the window. Period.

3) Work closely with your HR support. They need to be brought along on this journey. You should have women and people of color in the running for every single job opening.

4) Make connections. We all gravitate towards people that are like us. Make an effort to open up that circle to people with other interests, abilities, skin colors, sexualities, political differences, social backgrounds, and genders (conforming or non).

### Keep on learning

Check in with your team and yourself on a regular basis. If you have the ability, run regular audits on your hiring process to make sure that it's working. Tweak as needed.

I'll wrap this up by saying that nobody is perfect. No company is perfect. I'm personally struggling to adapt these very points in my own job.

We should all strive to do better for everyone, ourselves included.
